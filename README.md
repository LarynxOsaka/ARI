Acoustic Roughness Index scripts activated in Praat software.

This repository contains the ARI custom script designed for use with Praat, a free acoustic analysis software.

This script enables users to analyze acoustic parameters from continuous speech and sustained vowel audio files.

Below are step-by-step instructions to help you get started.ã€€ã€€

# Prerequisites
## Download and install Praat:
Visit the Praat website. (https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/)

Linux (any distribution with GTK+)

### 2. Installation guideInstructions
Typical Installation Time:
Less than 2 minutes on a standard desktop computer.
  
### 3. DemoInstructions to run on data
Expected Run Time:
Analysis of a typical 20-second audio file: Less than 30 seconds on a standard desktop computer.

## Prepare the audio files:
Ensure you have the required audio files ready for analysis:

ãƒ»Continuous Speech Audio File

ãƒ»Sustained Vowel Audio File

Voice samples should be recorded in an acoustically treated room and stored as a digitised WAV. format with a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz and 16-bit resolution using a head-mounted microphone, and meet the generally required level of signal-to-noise ratio (>30 dB). 

These should be from the same patient to ensure consistency in the analysis.

Save directory: Specify the directory where the analysis results should be saved.

Click OK after entering all parameters.

The script will generate:ã€€ã€€

ãƒ»Excel file: Lists values for each analyzed parameter.ã€€

ãƒ»PNG file: Visual representation of the analysis results.ã€€
